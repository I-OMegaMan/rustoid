# rustoid
A journey of a C programmer learning Rust.

# Book
I will be loosely and slowly following this very good and interactive rust book.

# Initial thoughts on Rust
I am a C and C++ developer in the embedded and systems programming space.

I don't consider myself particularly attached to any of the languages
that I know or have programmed in, however I do believe they are the
right tool for the job.

My understanding of rust is that the language intends to "replace" C
and possibly C++ for applications in my industry. Selling points being: 

- Rust claims to be memory safe, at least in terms of dynamically allocated memory.
- allows for some form of auto-magic thread safety, I will need to understand this more.
- is as fast as C, this should be an easy one since any compiled and optimized language should be as fast as C. (This is purely a compiler related issue).

# Rustoids
99% of bugs I've dealt with in my career are related to SQA issues, system issues, timing issues, and requirements related bugs. This means that had you programmed the language in ada, java or lisp you would have seen the same problems.

An enthusiastic Reddit user from r/rust, claimed that had I written the products using rust I would have considered the requirements better or discovered these timing issues. This is the mind of the rustoid. Will I become one after this project?
